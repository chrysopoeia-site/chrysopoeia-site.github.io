<p>2Tags for a post are defined in the post’s front matter using either the key tag for a single entry or tags for multiple entries.
Since Jekyll expects multiple items mapped to the key tags, it will automatically split a string entry if it contains whitespace. For example, while front matter tag: classic hollywood will be processed into a singular entity “classic hollywood”, front matter tags: classic hollywood will be processed into an array of entries [“classic”, “hollywood”].</p>

<p>Irrespective of the front matter key chosen, Jekyll stores the metadata mapped to the plural key which is exposed to Liquid templates.</p>

<p>All tags registered in the current site are exposed to Liquid templates via site.tags. Iterating over site.tags on a page will yield another array with two items, where the first item is the name of the tag and the second item being an array of posts with that tag.</p>
