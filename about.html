            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>Chrysopoeia is the alchemical process of transmuting lesser metals into gold. It is also a nice word. My reason for choosing it is more for the latter, but the concept is still cool.</p>
            <h2>Technical Stuff</h2>
            <p>This site was hand-coded and for better or worse, it shows. I used plain HTML, CSS, and <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll </a> for some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator" target="_blank">SSG action</a>. Javascript is only used for playing music.</p>
