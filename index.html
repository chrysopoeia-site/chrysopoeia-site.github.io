            History is over and we've all arrived at our
            final destination, <span class="red-bottom-light"><img justify="center" class="inline-img" src="{{page.img_fire}}" alt="fire gif">hell<img justify="center" class="inline-img" src="{{page.img_fire}}" alt="fire gif"></span>. But we still get to make websites and stuff.</i></p>
        <br>
        <h1>Welcome to Chrysopoeia</h1>
        <p>My name is tom and this is my personal site! In the event that this is the first “small web” site you’ve ever come across, here’s why I made it, and why I think you should make one too:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Social media, while indispensible in some form for the purpose of mass organizing, is principally a data-siphon used to construct profiles on all of us. Social media companies make billions of dollars by selling your data to brokers who then sell it to private companies and the <i>best</i> case scenario is that it's only used for advertising. It's sometimes used to <a href="{{page.url_404media}}" target="_blank">help the police and DHS</a> bolster the surveillance state. You shouldn't have to enter into a government database just to stay in touch with your aunt who lives out of state.</li>
            <li>Fuck generative AI and any platform that thrusts it upon its users. It steals from human artists and writers and then uses obscene amounts of water and electricity (the cost of which is subsidized by locals, whether they like it or not) to horf up some dogshit pastiche for capitalist chuds who fundamentally misunderstand art. Whatever you post on social media will almost certainly be used to train <i>some</i> LLM. A personal website is an opportunity to reject the corporate insistence that <i>you will train and use AI and you will like it.</i></li>
            <li>The centralized, corporatized internet is just so fucking <i>boring</i>. It's a personality vacuum. We've all just come to accept as fact that websites are for businesses. When was the last time you went to a website that wasn't either stealing from you or selling you something? What was the last website you went to whose design had idiosynracies that betrayed its creation by a real person? No one yet owns the internet; it's still all of ours. While that's still the case, we ought to build the websites we want to see and use.</li>
            <li>It’s fun to blog :-} There are no boxes where you must put things or guidelines about what is appropriate to post or how it should be displayed. It is a completely blank slate upon which you can pour as much of your life and personality as you wish. It is exactly whatever you want it to be. Make a page for every hobby. Build shrines to the specific things you care about. Join some webrings and meet people who desire neither your money nor your data. You <a href="{{page.url_neocities}}">don't even have to pay</a> for webhosting, if you don't want to; there's no multi-tiered subscription service required. Reclaim your humanity and individuality.</li>
        </ul>
<p>Anyways, that's my spiel. I'd love for you to stick around and check out my posts. I aim to post some kind of writing at least once a week. Thanks for listening!</p>
