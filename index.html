            History is over and we've all arrived at our
            final destination, <span class="red-bottom-light"><img justify="center" class="inline-img" src="{{page.img_fire}}" alt="fire gif">hell<img justify="center" class="inline-img" src="{{page.img_fire}}" alt="fire gif"></span>. But we still get to make websites and stuff.</i></p>

        <h1>Welcome to Chrysopoeia</h1>
        <p>It's the personal site of tom (me). It's hand coded and it
        fucking shows :'). In the event that this
        is the first “small web” site you’ve ever come across, here’s
        my reasoning:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Fuck AI and the slop it spits up.</li>
            <li>Social media, while indispensible in some form for the
                purpose of mass organizing, is used to construct
                profiles on all of us to make the owners billions of
                dollars by selling to data brokers who then sell profiles
                to private companies whose activities include advertising to us at least harmful
                end of the spectrum, and enabling the police to <a href="{{page.url_404media}}" target="_blank">surveil us</a> further along it.
                It is also riddled with terminal ligma.<img class="inline-img" justify="center"src="{{page.img_sad_emotiguy}}" alt="sad emotiguy">
            </li>
            <li>The centralized, corporatized, data-harvesting modern
                Web 2.0/3.0 internet landscape was a mistake that has
                resulted in dystopian outcomes, the worst of which
                we’ve only began to glimpse (for instance, the
                Shmepartment of Shmomeland Shmecurity is using harvested
                social media data in conjunction with AI to bolster the
                already thorough Shmershmailence Shtate, to say nothing
                of fucking <i>military AI drones</i>), and worst of all
                is that it's so fucking <i>boring</i>. We must all rebuild
                the vines and trees of days gone by.</li>
            <li>It’s fun to blog :-}</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I like to make music (sometimes classical instrumentation,
        sometimes guitar stuff, sometimes electronic stuff, etc.), read, 
        write (like right now!), mess around with stationery and
        journals, and try out lots of new hobbies. I’m starting this
        blog to be a hub for all of those things and hopefully, to engage
        with them a little more thoughtfully.</p>

        <p>I aim to post some kind of writing at least once a week. I pray
        that I stick to it ;-; I’d love for you to check out some of the
        stuff that I put out!</p>
