This is just me gushing about how much I love this album! From start to finish the lyricism and emotionality is so beautiful. It starts off with a very powerful, huge sound in "Premonitory Dream" and "Wool in the Wash" and later cools down to such slow beauty with "Well and Spring". By the time you reach the next to last track, "Beyond the Fleeting Gales", it feels like you've reached not only the end of a journey, but the end of all journeys. I'd list it as one of my "beautiful songs to watch the end of the world to".
